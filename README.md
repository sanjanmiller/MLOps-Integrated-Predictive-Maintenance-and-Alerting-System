# 🚀 MLOps-Integrated Predictive Maintenance and Alerting System  

This project implements an **MLOps pipeline** for **predictive maintenance in vehicle engines**. It integrates **anomaly detection using One-Class SVM**, **SHAP analysis for explainability**, and an **automated email alert system** to notify vehicle owners about potential engine issues. **MLflow** is used for experiment tracking and logging key metrics.  

## 📌 Features  
✔️ **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies abnormal engine conditions using **One-Class SVM**.  
✔️ **SHAP Explainability**: Provides insights into which sensor readings contribute most to anomalies.  
✔️ **Automated Email Alerts**: Notifies customers via email if anomalies persist.  
✔️ **MLflow Integration**: Tracks parameters, metrics, and SHAP importance scores for MLOps compliance.
